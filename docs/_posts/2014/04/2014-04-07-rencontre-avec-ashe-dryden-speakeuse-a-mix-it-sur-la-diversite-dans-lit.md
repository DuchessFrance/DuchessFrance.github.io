| Pour continuer cette série d'interview de développeuses, je vous propose d'en apprendre un peu plus sur [Ashe Dryden](http://www.ashedryden.com/ "Ashe Dryden").  Ashe est connue dans la communauté des rubystes. Mais elle ne donnera pas de talk sur Ruby lors de la conférence [Mix-it](http://www.mix-it.fr/ "Mix-it") (Lyon, le 29-30 avril), elle animera plutôt la session [Programming Diversity](http://www.mix-it.fr/session/509/programming-diversity- "Programming diversity - Mix-it"). Elle est l'auteur du livre ["The Diverse Team"](https://leanpub.com/the-diverse-team). |

**Ludwine : Who are you ?**

**Ashe :** My name is Ashe Dryden. I've been a programmer for the past 13 years, but for the past 2 I've been focused on increasing diversity in tech.

**Ludwine : Could you describe your typical day ?**

**Ashe :** My days are so varied! I spend a good amount of my time traveling for conferences and other events, educating people about diversity and inclusivity work. I do consulting with conferences and startups on what they can do to be more accessible to all kinds of people. In between all of that, I do a lot of writing, both for my book as well as online where I do culture critique and resource creation. I also do a lot of work over email - helping people who are in tough situations with nowhere to go, connecting people who are looking for a better working environment, or pointing people toward resources that will help them discuss things with their companies.

**Ludwine : You will talk about Programming Diversity at Mix-IT. Could you tell us more ?**

**Ashe :** The talk covers why we have a lack of diversity in tech, why diversity is important to everyone, and what we can do about it. It includes a lot of research I've done over the past couple years.

**Ludwine : You are very invested in the IT community. What gives you this energy? What/who inspires you ?**

**Ashe :** I am very invested, yes, because this is the only field I've ever known. I love programming and want everyone to have the access and opportunity without being pushed out prematurely. Truthfully, new programmers inspire me the most. I speak to a lot of people just discovering their passion for programming and seeing them get excited about making things for themselves makes me remember why I love it and why it's important to improve the outlook for all programmers.

**Merci Ashe pour cette interview :)**

**Retrouvez-là à Mix-it !**
